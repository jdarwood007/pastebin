I've never been good at writing these, so here it goes.

See license.txt for the license this script uses.

*** Install ***
1. Upload files
2. Modify settings.php to accommodate your needs.
	a. When using SMF as the database, you muse set the correct path in smf_dir to your SMF install.
	b. When using SMF as the database, you must set the smf_paste_board to a valid board id.
3. Done.

*** Geshi ***
You can download and install the geshi syntax highlighter. Just need to set that up in settings once you do.
